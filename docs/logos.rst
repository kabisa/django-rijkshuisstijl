Customizing logos
=================

Due to restrictions on the official Dutch government logos, only placeholders are provided. Official logo's can be
requested on the official website of the Dutch government branding (http://www.rijkshuisstijl.nl). Once a logo is
provided you can override the following static files to use them:

- static/rijkshuisstijl/components/logo-mobile.png
- static/rijkshuisstijl/components/logo-mobile.svg
- static/rijkshuisstijl/components/logo-tablet.png
- static/rijkshuisstijl/components/logo-tablet.svg

The "mobile" logos are used on smaller screen sizes and should have a resolution of 40x60 pixels.
The "tablet" logos are used on tablets and larger devices and should have a resolution of 314*125 pixels.
